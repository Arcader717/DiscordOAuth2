**Async or Sync?**
While there may be issues between the differences of the two repositories, remember that this repository is the async version, and not the [sync repository](https://github.com/Arcader717/DisOAuth2), so there will be `async def` and `await` statements in this repository

**Context**
Try to provide the file and line where the difference is for BOTH repositories

**Reminder**
While it may happen, remember, if the update was made recently on the sync repository, it will be made to the async repository soon after, so wait until the update for the async version to report
